# Sentiment analysis for Youtube comments
## Introduction
This is a Big data analytics project that aim to use the sentiment analysis for youtube comments to achive two goals :
  1. Firstly, Check the level of positivity toeards the vedio.
      **Note**: positivity = the ratio between positive comments and the total number of comments
  2. Secondly, See the Category distribution of the vedio. In other words, the intersection of cateogries that the vedio belong to.
 
## Motivation 
* Comments and level of Engagement :
The level of engagement represented by the comments is much higher than by the reacts. Moreover,There is high correlation between  discussion rank and the number of comments.
In addition,The comments have more verification over the positivity or the negativity of the videos, compared  to the reacts. The following image illustrate the level of engagement on social media:
